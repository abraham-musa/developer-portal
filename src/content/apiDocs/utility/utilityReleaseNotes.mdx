# Address Validation

## September 26, 2018
Create Address Validation API [#336](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-contrib/commit/646a1c45df3c58f361ea523afc9e772dfa07999a)
- The ‘validate’ API accepts a structured JSON address object (broken down by street/city/state/zip/etc), and returns a result indicating whether the address is valid, and if so includes a canonicalized address and geocoding information (lat/long) for the address.
